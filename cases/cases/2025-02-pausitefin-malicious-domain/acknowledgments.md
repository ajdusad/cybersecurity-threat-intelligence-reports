🛡️ Open Source Cybersecurity: Documenting Threat Intelligence for Public Good

I'm excited to share my first cybersecurity case study - publicly documented 
on GitHub for transparency and community learning.

🔍 Case Summary:
Identified and analyzed a malicious domain (pausitefin.site) exhibiting 
forced fullscreen behavior - a common technique for malware delivery and 
scam operations.

✅ Actions Taken:
- Technical analysis using Kali Linux, Nmap, DNS enumeration
- Documented complete IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
- Reported to National Cyber Crime Portal (Ack: 2190228001720)
- Created open-source case study for community awareness

📂 Full Case Study Available:

💡 Why Public Documentation Matters:
- Transparency in responsible disclosure
- Knowledge sharing with security community
- Educational resource for aspiring analysts
- Demonstrates professional methodology

This is the first of many contributions to the cybersecurity ecosystem. 
Every threat documented is a step toward a safer digital world.
